Steel Sample
Number of Cycles: [Enter Value]
Amplitude Stress: [Enter Value] MPa

Aluminium Sample
Number of Cycles: [Enter Value]
Amplitude Stress: [Enter Value] MPa

Step 4: Results.
S-N Curve for steel and Aluminium
- Endurance Limit for Steel is ~320 MPa.
- Fatigue strength for Aluminum alloys is ~163 MPa @ 10^7 cycles since the materials doesnâ€™t exhibit no endurance limit.
